# CGBP
Brain-inspired Chaotic Graph Backpropagation for Large-scale Combinatorial Optimization

### Example code
In this notebook ([mc_cgbp_example.ipynb](mc_cgbp_example.ipynb)) we show how to solve combinatorial optimization problems with brain-inspired chaotic graph backpropagation (CGBP) and physics-inspired graph neural networks (PIGNN). In this example, we focus on the canonical maximum cut (MC) problem, but our approach can easily be extended to other combinatorial optimization problems. 

The following figure directly compares the results of BP-based PIGNN and CGBP-based PIGNN on a 3-regular graph with 100 nodes
